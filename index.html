        <p>Mega Man, alternatively written as <em>Megaman</em> and <em>MegaMan</em>, known as <strong>Rockman</strong> (<strong>ロックマン</strong> <em>Rokkuman?</em>) in Japan, is a video game franchise from <strong>Capcom</strong>, starring the robot character Mega Man, or one of his many counterparts. Mega Man, released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1987, began a series of over 50 games on multiple systems. As of December 31, 2010, the series has sold approximately <strong>twenty-nine million copies worldwide</strong>, making it Capcom's most prolific franchise.</p>

        <p>The classic Mega Man series consists of <strong>ten main titles</strong> including the original game, as well as all <em>Game Boy</em> and PC titles featuring the original design of Mega Man. The classic series is considered to be the <em>origin of the story</em>, with Mega Man being the <strong>first installment</strong>, and continuing with ten direct sequels. Chronologically after <em>Mega Man 8 comes Mega Man & Bass</em>, followed by <em>Mega Man 9</em> and <em>Mega Man 10</em></p>

        <p>Although the classic series has yet to reach an ending, the storyline shifts to the <em>Mega Man X</em> series, followed by the <em>Mega Man Zero</em> series, <em>Mega Man ZX</em> and <em>Mega Man Legends</em>. Although it is confirmed that the Legends series takes place sometime in the <strong>distant future</strong> after the ZX series, there is an uncertain amount of time as to when it actually takes place. All series follow <strong>one continuous timeline</strong> except for <em>Mega Man Battle Network</em> and <em>Mega Man Star Force</em> which exist in an <strong>alternate universe</strong> (one in which network technology flourished instead of robotics technology), with <em>Star Force</em> occurring <strong>two centuries</strong> after the <em>Battle Network series</em>.</p>
